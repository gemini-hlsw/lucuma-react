# scalajs-react-window

A scalajs facade for [react-virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/) generated by [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org)

The facade has only been developed to the point where it is useful in [scalajs-react-table](https://github.com/toddburnside/scalajs-react-table). This essentially means that most of the Virtuoso component has been completed.
