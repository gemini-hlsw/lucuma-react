# scalajs-react-window

A minimal scalajs facade for [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) generated by [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org)

The facade has only been developed to the point where it is useful in [scalajs-react-table](https://github.com/toddburnside/scalajs-react-table)
